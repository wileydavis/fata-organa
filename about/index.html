        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>Fata Organa is an audio drama told across twelve transmissions. It is a story about consciousness, loss, and the things we build to avoid facing either one.</p>
        <p>The transmissions originate from within a Containment Zone — a place where the rules that hold reality together have come undone. Someone is broadcasting from inside. These recordings are what was recovered.</p>

        <h2>The Website</h2>
        <p>This site is not just a home for the podcast. It is a living record of the project's creation. As Fata Organa is written, scored, and produced, this site updates — documenting the process in real time.</p>
        <p>The archive contains materials that serve double duty: they are production documents (sound design notes, story bibles, terminology guides) and they are world-building artifacts (field manuals, recovered documents, decoded transmissions). The line between the two is intentionally thin.</p>
        <p>When the project is complete, this site will fix in place — a permanent record of both the finished work and the path that led to it.</p>

        <h2>The Creator</h2>
        <p>Fata Organa is created by Wiley Davis — a designer, builder, and maker based in Southern California. The project spans writing, sound design, music production, and web development, and is being produced independently.</p>

        <h2>Subscribe</h2>
        <p>The podcast is not yet available. When the first transmission is decoded, it will be distributed via major podcast platforms and available for direct download from this site.</p>
