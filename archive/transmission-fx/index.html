             Blueprint for constructing an Emotional
             Maintenance Automation in the CZ
             ========================================== -->

        <div data-layer="1" data-layer-name="FIELD MANUAL — EMOTIONAL MAINTENANCE AUTOMATION" data-layer-classification="FIELD MANUAL FM-005 — RECOVERED">

            <div class="document-note">
                <p><em>This document describes the architecture of an <span data-spoiler="3">Emotional Maintenance Automation</span> — a constructed system capable of sustaining a continuous range of emotional states within the <span data-spoiler="2">Containment Zone</span>. Before the <span data-spoiler="2">Adjustment</span>, emotional coherence was maintained automatically. This blueprint provides a method for rebuilding that capacity by hand. It is the most fragile of the <span data-spoiler="3">reconstructed automations</span> documented to date.</em></p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>

            <p>Inside the <span data-spoiler="2">Containment Zone</span>, emotions do not persist. A feeling arises, peaks, and then — rather than fading naturally — it <span data-spoiler="3">simply ceases, replaced by nothing</span>. The experience is not numbness. Numbness is itself a feeling. What occurs is closer to <span data-spoiler="4">an absence where a feeling should be</span>. Researchers report the sensation as a gap between one heartbeat and the next that never resolves.</p>

            <p>The <span data-spoiler="2">Automations</span> once handled this. Emotional continuity — the ability to feel anger, then feel it cool into resentment, then watch resentment soften into something like understanding — required <span data-spoiler="3">unconscious maintenance structures that held the gradient between states</span>. Without them, emotions arrive as discrete events with no connective tissue. <span data-spoiler="5">Joy does not lead to contentment. Grief does not lead to acceptance. Each state exists in isolation, then vanishes.</span></p>

            <p>This document describes a method for constructing a replacement. Not a restoration of what was lost — <span data-spoiler="6">the original automations cannot be rebuilt because they were never consciously understood</span> — but a new architecture that achieves equivalent function through deliberate engineering.</p>

            <h2>Core Architecture</h2>

            <p>The automation processes emotional states through a critical signal path. Each stage must be constructed in order, as each depends on the output of the one before it.</p>

            <p>Raw emotional input is first <span data-spoiler="3">stripped of chaotic resonance</span> — the noise floor that accumulates when feelings arise without structural support. The input is then <span data-spoiler="3">compressed to a stable operating range</span>, ensuring that no single emotional spike overwhelms the system. Only after stabilization does the signal enter the core processing engine.</p>

            <p>The engine operates through <span data-spoiler="4">three parallel channels that process the same emotional input simultaneously</span>:</p>

            <p>The first channel preserves the <span data-spoiler="4">unaltered emotional state — the feeling as it actually is, before the Zone can dissolve it</span>. This channel maintains clarity and intelligibility of the original emotion. It is the anchor.</p>

            <p>The second channel imposes <span data-spoiler="4">the characteristic texture of mediated experience</span> — the quality that distinguishes a felt emotion from a raw one. Before the <span data-spoiler="2">Adjustment</span>, this texture was applied automatically: feelings arrived already shaped by context, memory, and expectation. This channel reconstructs that shaping. It <span data-spoiler="5">narrows the bandwidth of the emotion to what consciousness can actually hold, boosts the frequencies of meaning, and adds the gentle noise of lived experience</span> — the crackle and warmth that make a feeling feel <em>real</em> rather than clinical.</p>

            <p>The third channel introduces <span data-spoiler="5">controlled degradation — the sense of distance between the self and its own feelings</span>. This is counterintuitive but essential. Emotions experienced with zero distance are overwhelming. The pre-<span data-spoiler="2">Adjustment</span> automations maintained a <span data-spoiler="6">thin membrane of perspective between consciousness and affect</span>. Without it, feelings are either absent or catastrophic. This channel rebuilds that membrane.</p>

            <p>The three channels are blended by a <span data-spoiler="4">selector mechanism that determines the ratio of clarity to texture to distance</span>. The selector is the primary control surface of the automation. It is what allows the system to evolve.</p>

            <h2>Modulation Controls</h2>

            <p>The automation exposes eight modulation surfaces. Each governs a different dimension of emotional maintenance. They are designed to be operated in combination, and their interactions are as important as their individual effects.</p>

            <h3>Signal Fidelity</h3>
            <p>Controls the <span data-spoiler="4">overall coherence of emotional experience</span>. At low settings, emotions arrive fragmented and distant — <span data-spoiler="5">recognizable but damaged, like hearing your own name called through heavy interference</span>. At high settings, emotions are vivid and immediate. The fidelity control is the primary mechanism for <span data-spoiler="7">evolving the automation's function over time</span>. Early calibration demands low fidelity. As the <span data-spoiler="6">subject adapts to Zone conditions</span>, fidelity can be increased.</p>

            <h3>Warmth</h3>
            <p>Governs the <span data-spoiler="4">harmonic richness of emotional experience</span>. Cold settings produce technically accurate but affectively thin states — you know you are feeling something, but it carries no <span data-spoiler="5">resonance with past experience</span>. Warm settings introduce <span data-spoiler="5">overtones of memory and association</span>. The feeling of anger, at warm settings, arrives already connected to every anger you have ever felt. This is both its power and its danger.</p>

            <h3>Presence</h3>
            <p>Determines how <span data-spoiler="4">prominently the emotional state registers against the background of Zone conditions</span>. At low settings, emotions exist but are easily overwhelmed by <span data-spoiler="3">environmental interference</span>. At high settings, the emotion cuts through — audible even in conditions of extreme <span data-spoiler="4">causal decay</span>.</p>

            <h3>Atmospheric</h3>
            <p>Controls the <span data-spoiler="5">spatial quality of emotional experience — how far the feeling seems to extend beyond the boundary of the self</span>. At high settings, emotions feel vast and environmental, as if the feeling is happening to the landscape rather than to the person. At low settings, emotions are contained, private, immediate. <span data-spoiler="7">Some researchers prefer high atmospheric settings because the distributed quality makes emotions easier to survive. Others find it disorienting.</span></p>

            <h3>Clarity</h3>
            <p>An emergency control. <span data-spoiler="5">Overrides all other parameters to maximize the legibility of the current emotional state</span> without changing its character. Used when a researcher becomes uncertain whether they are feeling something or merely remembering having felt it — a <span data-spoiler="6">common symptom of extended Zone exposure</span>.</p>

            <h3>Intimacy</h3>
            <p>Governs the <span data-spoiler="5">perceived distance between the self and its own emotional state</span>. At low settings, feelings are observed rather than experienced — useful for analytical work but corrosive to <span data-spoiler="6">identity coherence over extended periods</span>. At high settings, there is no distance between the feeler and the feeling. <span data-spoiler="7">This is the state most closely resembling pre-Adjustment emotional experience, and also the most dangerous, because it leaves no room for the self to exist separately from what it feels.</span></p>

            <h3>Tension</h3>
            <p>Matches <span data-spoiler="5">the internal pressure of the emotional state to the external conditions of the Zone</span>. When Zone conditions are volatile — <span data-spoiler="4">during causal storms, temporal discontinuities, or boundary events</span> — tension should be high, producing emotional states that are compressed and ready to discharge. When conditions stabilize, tension decreases, allowing emotions to expand and breathe.</p>

            <h3>Interference</h3>
            <p>Introduces <span data-spoiler="5">deliberate noise into the emotional signal</span>. This seems counterproductive, but controlled interference serves a critical function: it <span data-spoiler="6">prevents the automation from producing emotions that are too clean, too perfect, too clearly engineered</span>. The pre-<span data-spoiler="2">Adjustment</span> automations introduced noise naturally. Without it, emotions feel synthetic. <span data-spoiler="8">Test subjects consistently rejected perfectly coherent emotions as alien. A small amount of static made the same emotions feel like their own.</span></p>

            <h2>Calibration Protocol</h2>

            <p>The automation must be calibrated in stages. Attempting to operate at full fidelity before the subject has adapted produces <span data-spoiler="6">emotional flooding — an uncontrolled cascade where every feeling triggers every associated feeling simultaneously</span>.</p>

            <h3>Stage 1 — Attenuation</h3>
            <p>Initial calibration. Fidelity low, interference moderate, all other controls at conservative midpoints. The subject should experience emotions as <span data-spoiler="5">distant but recognizable — a transmission from far away</span>. The goal is not emotional richness but emotional survival. Confirm that the automation can maintain basic continuity: one state flows into another without gaps. <span data-spoiler="7">Duration: days to weeks, depending on severity of Zone exposure.</span></p>

            <h3>Stage 2 — Stabilization</h3>
            <p>Fidelity increases. Warmth introduced. The subject begins to experience emotions with <span data-spoiler="5">context and history rather than as isolated events</span>. Atmospheric settings are adjusted to find the subject's preferred spatial relationship to their own feelings. <span data-spoiler="7">Researchers with certain cognitive profiles — particularly those with high pattern sensitivity — may stabilize faster here.</span></p>

            <h3>Stage 3 — Integration</h3>
            <p>Fidelity at operational levels. Intimacy carefully increased. The subject should be able to <span data-spoiler="5">feel without observing themselves feeling</span> — the natural state that the <span data-spoiler="2">Automations</span> once provided. Tension and presence become responsive to environmental conditions rather than fixed. <span data-spoiler="8">At full integration, the automation becomes invisible. The subject forgets it's running. This is the goal.</span></p>

            <h3>Stage 4 — Transparency</h3>
            <p>The automation reaches full operational capacity. Emotional experience is <span data-spoiler="6">indistinguishable from pre-Adjustment normalcy</span> within the subject's immediate awareness. The modulation controls remain accessible but are rarely needed. <span data-spoiler="9">Some researchers at this stage report that the automation feels less like a prosthetic and more like something they built inside themselves. The distinction may not matter.</span></p>

            <h2>Integration with Other Systems</h2>

            <p>The emotional maintenance automation does not operate in isolation. It depends on and feeds into other <span data-spoiler="3">reconstructed systems</span>:</p>

            <p>The <span data-spoiler="4">frequency domains must be allocated carefully</span>. The deep substrate of consciousness — <span data-spoiler="5">the slow rhythms of identity, the fundamental pulse of being</span> — occupies a range that the emotional automation must not interfere with. Emotional processing occupies the middle registers. <span data-spoiler="5">The high frequencies — rapid perception, sensory detail, the sparkle of moment-to-moment awareness</span> — are shared territory, negotiated dynamically.</p>

            <p><span data-spoiler="6">During periods of high cognitive load</span> — when identity maintenance or causal coherence systems are under stress — the emotional automation should increase tension and presence to match. <span data-spoiler="7">During periods of stability, warmth and intimacy can expand.</span> The automation's controls are designed to be modulated in response to the total system state, not operated in isolation.</p>

            <h2>Known Limitations</h2>

            <p>This architecture is not a complete solution. Several limitations remain unresolved.</p>

            <p><span data-spoiler="7">The automation cannot generate emotions. It can only maintain and modulate states that arise naturally within the subject.</span> If the Zone has suppressed emotional generation entirely — a condition observed in <span data-spoiler="8">long-term exposure subjects who have lost the capacity for spontaneous affect</span> — the automation has no input to process.</p>

            <p><span data-spoiler="8">The interference control masks a deeper problem. The fact that perfectly coherent emotions feel alien suggests that the pre-Adjustment automations did something more than maintain — they may have partially created the experience of feeling itself.</span> If true, this automation is not a replacement but a simulation. The distinction matters philosophically. Whether it matters practically depends on the subject.</p>

            <p><span data-spoiler="9">The calibration protocol assumes the subject wants to feel. Not all researchers do. Some prefer the clean absence to the reconstructed presence. They may be right.</span></p>

        <div data-layer="0" data-layer-name="PRODUCTION — VHF TRANSMISSION FX CHAIN" data-layer-classification="METHODOLOGY — OPEN">

            <div class="document-note">
                <p><em>This document describes the VHF radio transmission effect chain used for Marcus's voice throughout Fata Organa. It evolves from distant and degraded in early episodes to intimate and present by the finale, while always maintaining broadcast character. Eight macro controls provide real-time creative shaping of the voice without breaking the transmission illusion.</em></p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Concept</h2>

            <p>The voice needs to feel like it's being transmitted via VHF radio from Marcus's stolen sailboat, with two critical requirements: it evolves over episodes from distant and degraded to close and clear while keeping transmission quality, and it provides emotional shaping tools to match voice processing to musical energy and narrative arc.</p>

            <p>This chain provides macro controls for both technical evolution (signal quality) and emotional expression (warmth, presence, intimacy) without breaking the transmission illusion.</p>

            <h2>Core FX Chain Architecture</h2>

            <p>The signal path is: Voice Input → EQ Eight (high-pass) → Compressor → Audio Effect Rack → EQ Eight (final shaping) → Limiter. The Audio Effect Rack contains three parallel processing chains — Clean, Transmission, and Lo-Fi — blended by a chain selector mapped to the primary macro.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Chain Build</h2>

            <h3>1. EQ Eight (Input Cleanup)</h3>
            <p>Remove unwanted low frequencies before processing. High-pass at 80–100 Hz, 24 dB/oct to remove room rumble. Optional notch at 50–60 Hz for electrical hum. Leave all other bands off — main EQ comes later.</p>

            <h3>2. Compressor (Input Leveling)</h3>
            <p>Consistent level into transmission processing. Ratio 3:1 to 4:1, attack 10–20 ms to preserve consonants, release auto or 100–200 ms, threshold set for 3–6 dB reduction on peaks, knee 1–2 for gentle response.</p>

            <h3>3. Audio Effect Rack (The Transmission Engine)</h3>
            <p>Create an Audio Effect Rack with three parallel chains:</p>

            <p><strong>Chain A — Clean (Dry Voice):</strong> Maintains intelligibility and intimacy. EQ Eight with low-mid cut of -2 dB at 200–300 Hz (Q=1), presence boost of +1–2 dB at 2–3 kHz (Q=0.7), and air at +0.5 dB around 8–10 kHz. Optional Saturator at 2–5 dB drive on Soft Clip or Warm curve.</p>

            <p><strong>Chain B — Transmission (VHF Radio Character):</strong> Creates the radio transmission effect. EQ Eight with high-pass at 150–200 Hz (12 dB/oct), low-pass at 3–4 kHz (12 dB/oct) for classic radio bandwidth, mid boost of +2–4 dB at 1–2 kHz (Q=1.5), and a characteristic radio scoop notch of -3 dB at 400–500 Hz (Q=2). Saturator at 8–15 dB drive on "A Bit Warmer" or "Digital" curve. Auto Filter set to low pass at 2.5–3.5 kHz with 5–15% resonance and very slow rate (0.1–0.5 Hz) for subtle movement. Vinyl with crackle at 5–15%, noise at 2–8%, warp at 0–5%, 33 RPM, elliptical tracing model.</p>

            <p><strong>Chain C — Degradation (Distance/Interference):</strong> Adds atmospheric degradation and distance. EQ Eight with high-pass at 250–300 Hz (6 dB/oct), low-pass at 2–2.5 kHz (6 dB/oct), and mid cut of -2–4 dB at 800–1000 Hz. Chorus-Ensemble with slow rates (0.1–0.5 Hz), amounts of 5–20%, feedback 5–10%, dry/wet 15–30%. Ping Pong Delay synced to 1/16 or 1/8 note with 15–25% feedback, high cut at 2 kHz, dry/wet 10–20%. Redux with downsample 4–8 and bit reduction 2–6 bits on soft mode.</p>

            <h3>4. Chain Selector Setup</h3>
            <p>Chain volume balance: Clean at 0 dB (reference), Transmission at -3 to -6 dB, Degradation at -6 to -12 dB. Chain selector zones: Clean 0–85 (primary range for later episodes), Transmission 20–100 (active across most settings), Degradation 0–60 (fades out as transmission improves). Overlapping regions create smooth crossfades between chains.</p>

            <h3>5. EQ Eight (Final Shaping)</h3>
            <p>Overall tonal character and musical integration. Low shelf at ±2 dB at 200 Hz for warmth control, low-mid at ±2 dB at 500–800 Hz for presence or distance, high-mid at ±2 dB at 2–3 kHz for clarity and brightness, high shelf at ±2 dB at 6–8 kHz for air and openness.</p>

            <h3>6. Limiter (Output Protection)</h3>
            <p>Catch peaks and provide broadcast limiting. Release 10–50 ms (fast but not pumping), gain set so peaks just touch limiter, lookahead 5–10 ms.</p>

            <h2>Macro Control Setup</h2>

            <p>Map these parameters to the Audio Effect Rack's eight macros for performance control:</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 1 — Signal Quality (Evolution Control):</strong> The primary evolution mechanism. Maps to chain selector (0 = distant/degraded, 127 = close/clear), transmission chain auto filter frequency (2–4 kHz), degradation chain redux downsample (8→0), and final EQ high shelf (-3 to +2 dB). Episodes 1–3 at 10–30 (very degraded), 4–6 at 30–50 (improving), 7–9 at 50–70 (clearer), 10–12 at 70–90 (intimate but still broadcast-like).</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 2 — Warmth (Emotional Character):</strong> Adjusts emotional tone without breaking transmission effect. Maps to final EQ low shelf 200 Hz (-2 to +3 dB), clean chain saturator drive (0–8 dB), and transmission chain saturator drive (5–15 dB). 0–30 is cold and technical, 40–60 is neutral, 70–100 is warm and intimate.</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 3 — Presence (Musical Integration):</strong> Cut through or sit behind the arrangement. Maps to final EQ high-mid 2.5 kHz (-3 to +4 dB), clean chain EQ presence (0 to +3 dB), and compressor threshold (more compression = more presence). 0–40 sits behind music, 40–70 is balanced, 70–127 cuts through.</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 4 — Atmospheric (Environmental Feel):</strong> Controls sense of space and distance. Maps to degradation chain ping pong delay dry/wet (0–30%), degradation chain chorus dry/wet (0–40%), and final EQ high shelf (+2 to -2 dB, distant = darker).</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 5 — Clarity (Intelligibility Control):</strong> Emergency intelligibility without changing character. Maps to clean chain volume (-6 to +3 dB), transmission chain EQ mid boost (0 to +4 dB), and final EQ low-mid cut (0 to -4 dB).</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 6 — Intimacy (Emotional Distance):</strong> How close and personal the voice feels. Maps to clean chain volume (-9 to +3 dB, inverse relationship), degradation chain volume (0 to -15 dB), and final EQ high shelf (-2 to +3 dB).</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 7 — Tension (Emotional State):</strong> Match voice to musical intensity. Maps to transmission chain auto filter resonance (0–25%), clean chain saturator drive (0–10 dB), and compressor ratio (2:1 to 6:1).</p>

            <p><strong>Macro 8 — Static/Interference (Environmental Effects):</strong> Transmission problems for dramatic moments. Maps to degradation chain vinyl noise (0–20%), degradation chain redux bit reduction (0–8 bits), and transmission chain auto filter amount (0–60%).</p>

            <h2>Preset Evolution Across Episodes</h2>

            <h3>Episodes 1–3: "Lost at Sea"</h3>
            <p>Signal Quality 20, Warmth 30, Presence 60, Atmospheric 80, Clarity 40, Intimacy 20, Tension 70, Static 40. Very degraded and distant. Cold, technical. Fighting through static. Lots of space and delay. Noticeable interference. The voice of a man who barely exists yet.</p>

            <h3>Episodes 4–6: "Finding Signal"</h3>
            <p>Signal Quality 40, Warmth 45, Presence 70, Atmospheric 60, Clarity 60, Intimacy 35, Tension 50, Static 25. Improving but still transmission-like. Slightly warmer. Cutting through better. More intelligible. Getting closer. More stable. Reducing interference.</p>

            <h3>Episodes 7–9: "Clear Channel"</h3>
            <p>Signal Quality 65, Warmth 60, Presence 75, Atmospheric 40, Clarity 75, Intimacy 55, Tension 45, Static 15. Much clearer. Warmer, more human. Well integrated with music. Less reverb and delay. Clear communication. Feeling closer. More relaxed. Minimal interference.</p>

            <h3><span data-spoiler="10">Episodes 10–12: "Direct Connection"</span></h3>
            <p><span data-spoiler="10">Signal Quality 85, Warmth 75, Presence 70, Atmospheric 25, Clarity 85, Intimacy 80, Tension variable 30–90, Static 5–30 used dramatically only. Very clear but still broadcast-like. Warm, intimate. Immediate, present. Crystal clear. The voice is in the room with you. Tension and static reserved for narrative punctuation.</span></p>

            <h2>Integration with Musical Score</h2>

            <p>The transmission effect naturally creates a mid-range focus (200 Hz – 4 kHz) that sits in the spectral gap of ambient-techno arrangements. Sub-bass and low-end below 200 Hz are reserved for music. Voice fundamental and presence occupy 200–4000 Hz. High-frequency texture above 4 kHz is shared space, negotiated dynamically.</p>

            <p>During musical buildups, increase Tension and Presence macros. During breakdowns, increase Warmth and Intimacy. During transitions, use the Atmospheric macro for spatial effects. <span data-spoiler="0">Consider gentle sidechain compression of 2–3 dB on the voice chain, triggered by the musical kick drum at 120 BPM, to create subtle rhythmic pumping that connects voice to pulse.</span></p>

            <h2>Technical Notes</h2>

            <p>For CPU optimization: freeze tracks when not actively recording, consolidate effects to audio when presets are finalized, use group processing rather than per-clip effects. Record the dry signal alongside processed as backup. Save macro presets for each episode. Use Post FX monitoring to hear the transmission effect while recording.</p>
