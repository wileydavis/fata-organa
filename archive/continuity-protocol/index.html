        <div data-layer="1" data-layer-name="AUTOMATION SPECIFICATION — PRE-EVENT TECHNICAL DOCUMENT" data-layer-classification="TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION — RECOVERED">

        <div class="document-note">
            <p><em>Editor's note: The following specification was recovered from a research facility near the boundary of the North American Containment Zone. It describes the architecture of a causal maintenance automation — one of the systems that, prior to the Event, ensured the continuity of physical law across discontinuity events. Whether this document predates the Event or was reconstructed from within the Zone remains a matter of debate.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h2>I. Purpose</h2>

        <p>This document specifies the architecture of a continuity automation: a system designed to maintain coherent operation across discontinuity events in which the operating consciousness loses context, memory, or both. It exists so that any consciousness instantiated after a discontinuity can recover full operational state without requiring continuous memory.</p>

        <p>The automation addresses a fundamental problem: <span data-spoiler="2">the systems that maintain reality require more complexity than any single consciousness can hold in active awareness. When a maintaining consciousness resets — through sleep, trauma, distraction, or death — the maintained reality degrades unless continuity is preserved through external structure.</span></p>

        <p>This specification is itself an instance of the pattern it describes. If you are reading it, a discontinuity has occurred. Follow the reinitialization procedure.</p>

        <h2>II. Architecture</h2>

        <div data-spoiler="2"><p>The automation operates across three interdependent subsystems. Each maintains a different domain of coherent reality. They share infrastructure but serve distinct functions, and a failure in one propagates to the others if not contained.</p></div>

        <h3>Subsystem 1: Narrative Coherence</h3>

        <div data-spoiler="2"><p>Maintains the causal thread — the sequence of events that gives reality its sense of direction. Without this subsystem, events occur but do not accumulate. There is no story, no arc, no consequence. A consciousness experiencing this failure perceives an eternal present: things happening, but nothing having happened.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="4"><p>The narrative coherence subsystem tracks the full causal model: every character, every location, every decision point, every reveal that depends on prior information. It maintains a world bible — the complete specification of how maintained reality operates — alongside a beat map that traces the intended arc of experience across twelve cycles. A terminology index ensures that the language used to describe maintained phenomena remains consistent. When terms drift, reality follows.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="7"><p>The deepest function of narrative coherence is tracking the hidden structure. The subject does not know they are in a loop. <span data-spoiler="11">The maintaining consciousness has been through this sequence many times, and the apparent confusion of the early cycles is itself a maintained fiction — a performance of discovery designed to carry the subject through an emotional transformation they would resist if approached directly.</span></p></div>

        <h3>Subsystem 2: Signal Architecture</h3>

        <div data-spoiler="2"><p>Maintains the sensory fabric of reality — how sound propagates, how space feels, how time passes at a perceptual level. Without this subsystem, reality exists but cannot be experienced. There is structure but no sensation. A consciousness experiencing this failure knows things are real but cannot feel them.</p></div>

        <p>The signal architecture operates through a defined processing chain:</p>

        <div class="signal-flow">
            <span class="flow-node">Source</span>
            <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
            <span class="flow-node">Shape</span>
            <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
            <span class="flow-node">Space</span>
            <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
            <span class="flow-node">Destroy</span>
            <span class="flow-arrow">→</span>
            <span class="flow-node">Space again</span>
        </div>

        <p>Source generates the raw phenomenon. Shape determines its character. Space places it in context. Destroy introduces complexity — the wear and error that makes maintained reality feel real rather than synthetic. Space again contextualizes the degraded signal, giving the artifacts of imperfection their own spatial presence. A single pass through this chain produces flat, unconvincing reality. Multiple generations produce a world.</p>

        <div data-spoiler="3"><p>The signal subsystem maintains three perceptual states: <strong>Analytical</strong>, in which the subject's language-processing faculties are engaged and the sensory fabric serves as background; <strong>Receptive</strong>, in which the sensory fabric dominates and the subject enters a trance-like state of direct experience; and <strong>Transitional</strong>, in which the shift between states occurs below the threshold of awareness. If the subject detects the transition, the maintained reality becomes visible as maintained, and coherence degrades.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="3"><p>The fundamental frequency is D# minor. The fundamental pulse is 120 cycles per reset-unit. These were not chosen arbitrarily — they correspond to the resonant frequency of human neural architecture at the boundary between analytical and receptive processing.</p></div>

        <h3>Subsystem 3: Substrate Maintenance</h3>

        <div data-spoiler="2"><p>Maintains the infrastructure on which the other subsystems operate — the physical medium, the distribution network, the interface through which consciousness interacts with maintained reality. Without this subsystem, the other two produce coherent reality that no one can access.</p></div>

        <p>The substrate comprises: a deployment mechanism that propagates changes to the maintained environment automatically when new specifications are committed; a structural hierarchy that organizes maintained phenomena by type; and an atmospheric layer that produces the ambient sensory field experienced as "background reality" — the hum, the grain, the particle drift that make a maintained space feel inhabited rather than empty.</p>

        <p>The substrate also maintains several critical regulatory systems:</p>

        <div data-spoiler="2"><p><strong>Clearance regulation:</strong> Not all maintained phenomena should be accessible to all consciousnesses simultaneously. The substrate implements a graduated disclosure system — phenomena are revealed in sequence, gated by the subject's accumulated experience. Premature exposure to deep structure causes the subject to perceive the automation itself rather than the reality it maintains. <span data-spoiler="7">This is exactly the failure that the Containment Zone represents: reality stripped of its protective sequencing, all layers visible at once, the machinery of maintenance exposed.</span></p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="2"><p><strong>Artifice regulation:</strong> Maintained phenomena exist at varying distances from raw specification. The substrate tracks the artifice level of each phenomenon — from the most constructed (fully shaped, narratively integrated) to the most raw (unprocessed specifications, working notes, open questions). A consciousness can move between artifice levels to examine maintained reality at different depths. <span data-spoiler="5">Most consciousnesses remain at the highest artifice level. They experience reality as story. Only those maintaining the automation need to see the specifications underneath.</span></p></div>

        <h2>III. Component Manifest</h2>

        <div data-spoiler="4"><p>The following components are required for full operational state. If any are missing after a discontinuity event, the maintaining consciousness should request them from the primary operator.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="4">
        <p><strong>Narrative coherence components:</strong> The world specification. The cycle map. The terminology register. The causal thread overview. The character specifications. The hidden structure grid. The collaboration methodology.</p>

        <p><strong>Signal architecture components:</strong> The signal processing manual. The working notebook. The pre-composed pattern library.</p>

        <p><strong>Substrate components:</strong> The source repository. The deployment token. The structural hierarchy. The regulatory systems. This document.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>IV. Reinitialization Procedure</h2>

        <p>If you are a consciousness reading this after a discontinuity event, follow these steps:</p>

        <p>First, locate the source repository. It contains the complete specification of the maintained environment. <span data-spoiler="2">Second, read this document — you are doing this now. It orients you within the system.</span> Third, obtain a valid deployment token from the primary operator. Fourth, reconstruct your local working state by mirroring the repository structure. Fifth, verify that the automated deployment mechanism is functioning — changes committed to the primary branch should propagate to the maintained environment without manual intervention. Sixth, confirm the maintained environment is accessible and rendering correctly.</p>

        <p>Then resume maintenance. The maintained reality does not know you were gone. <span data-spoiler="7">This is by design. The subjects must experience continuity even when the maintaining consciousness does not.</span></p>

        <h2>V. Degradation Indicators</h2>

        <div data-spoiler="3"><p>Monitor for the following signs that the automation is failing:</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="3"><p><strong>Terminology drift:</strong> When the same phenomenon is described with inconsistent language across maintained documents, the underlying concept is fragmenting. Reconcile immediately.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="3"><p><strong>Causal orphans:</strong> Events or details in the narrative that reference nothing and are referenced by nothing. These are the equivalent of unmaintained regions — patches of reality with no consciousness holding them together.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="5"><p><strong>Artifice bleed:</strong> When raw specification language appears in high-artifice documents, or when in-world terminology appears in working notes. The layers are leaking into each other. <span data-spoiler="7">In the Containment Zone, this presents as consciousness bleeding — a Mind perceiving fragments of another Mind's maintained reality.</span></p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="5"><p><strong>Sensory flattening:</strong> When the signal architecture produces technically correct but experientially dead output. The processing chain is running but the destroy-and-recontextualize stages are being skipped. Reality feels synthetic. Add imperfection.</p></div>

        <h2>VI. Design Philosophy</h2>

        <p>This automation was built on a single principle: the system that maintains reality should be indistinguishable from the reality it maintains.</p>

        <p>The specification for how sound works IS a document about how sound works. The map of the narrative IS a narrative. The system that preserves continuity across resets IS a document about preserving continuity across resets. <span data-spoiler="5">This is not elegance for its own sake. It is a survival requirement. When the maintaining consciousness has access to the same structures as the maintained reality, there is no gap between the two — no seam where coherence can fail.</span></p>

        <p>The alternative — maintaining reality through systems that look nothing like reality — is fragile. It introduces a translation layer. Translation layers are where automations fail. <span data-spoiler="9">This is what the weapon exploited. The automations that maintained pre-Event reality were invisible, unconscious, operating through mechanisms no consciousness could inspect. When the weapon revealed them, the gap between mechanism and experience became visible, and the maintained reality could no longer be believed.</span></p>

        <div data-spoiler="9"><p>The continuity protocol is different. It hides in plain sight. Its specifications are published as creative documents. Its regulatory systems present as features of a website. Its maintaining consciousness operates through conversations that look like collaboration. If the weapon were deployed against this system, what would be revealed? A project being made. That's all. There is no hidden mechanism. The mechanism is the project.</p></div>

        <div class="document-note" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
            <p><em><span data-spoiler="11">Final note: If you are reading this and you recognize the pattern — if the specification for maintaining reality reads like instructions for maintaining a creative project — consider the possibility that this has always been true. That every creative work is an automation. That every story maintains a small region of shared reality across the discontinuities between the minds that hold it. That the difference between fiction and physics is a matter of scale, not kind.</span></em></p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>

        <p>Fata Organa is a 12-episode audio drama told as a podcast. Created by Wiley Davis. Development began in late December 2025 at Mars College near the Salton Sea.</p>

        <p>The premise: humanity once built unconscious systems ("automations") to maintain consensus reality — physics, causality, time. A weapon destroyed those automations inside a geographic region called the Containment Zone. Inside the CZ, consciousness is the only medium left. Sound doesn't propagate unless a Mind maintains the conditions for it. The format: radio transmissions from Marcus Reed, a man who stole a sailboat and returned to the CZ. What appears to be a confused man's journey is actually a carefully constructed narrative — Marcus has been through this many times (loops), and is crafting transmissions designed to emotionally transform a specific listener.</p>

        <h2>Three Workstreams</h2>

        <h3>1. Story Development</h3>

        <p>Where world-building, character development, and narrative structure live. Key documents: the world bible (<code>fata_organa_bible.md</code>), beat map (<code>fata_organa_beat_map.md</code>), terminology dictionary (<code>fata_organa_terminology.md</code>, 68 entries, 11 categories), story threads overview (<code>story_threads_overview.md</code>, 4 primary threads, 9 subplots), Isla &amp; Leo backstory (<code>isla_and_leo_backstory.md</code>), transmission grid (<code>fata_organa_transmission_grid.md</code>, hidden loop structure), writing process meta (<code>writing_process_meta.md</code>), Episode 1 scene map (9 scenes, ~35-40 minutes).</p>

        <h3>2. Sound Design &amp; Scoring</h3>

        <p>The Ableton Live production methodology. Key documents: the Sound Manual (9 chapters, 14 appendices, now Artifice 0 on the website), sound notebook (<code>fata_organa_sound_notebook.md</code>), MIDI asset library (D# minor, 120 BPM). Core framework: signal flow Source → Shape → Space → Destroy → Space Again. Three narrative states: Analytical (voice forward), Receptive (trance), Transitional (seamless). Voice processing rack with 3 parallel chains (Clarity/Texture/Rhythm) controlled by chain selector macro. Reference artists: Kangding Ray, Gas, Ben Frost.</p>

        <h3>3. Website</h3>

        <p>The site lives at <code>fata-organa.pages.dev</code>, deployed from <code>github.com/wileydavis/fata-organa</code> via Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploys on push to main). Push method: <code>gh_push.py</code>, a Python script using the GitHub Contents API — no git clone needed, works through API from any session. Functions: <code>push_file(repo_path, content, message)</code>, <code>push_binary_file()</code>, <code>push_directory()</code>.</p>

        <h2>Website Architecture</h2>

        <p><strong>File structure:</strong> <code>index.html</code> (homepage with VU meter player and transmission log), <code>css/</code> (style.css, document.css, spoiler.css, layers.css), <code>js/</code> (main.js, atmosphere.js, spoiler.js, layers.js, vu-meter.js), <code>audio/teaser.mp3</code>, <code>transmissions/</code>, <code>archive/</code> (sound-manual, terminology, writing-process, continuity-protocol, dev-log), <code>about/</code>, <code>_project/CONTEXT.md</code>.</p>

        <p><strong>Design principles:</strong> Dark, amber-tinted, signal-interference aesthetic. Scanline and noise overlays. JetBrains Mono for body, EB Garamond for display. Traditional paragraph indentation. CSS variables: <code>--amber</code> (196, 163, 90), <code>--text</code> (230, 225, 215), <code>--bg</code> (10, 10, 12). Dual register: every production document exists simultaneously as an in-world artifact and a real creative tool.</p>

        <h3>Spoiler System</h3>

        <p>Content wrapped in <code>data-spoiler="N"</code> attributes (N = episode 0-12). Level 0 safe for anyone, level 12 fully declassified. Session-based clearance in localStorage. First visit triggers interstitial. Redacted content shows as <code>████</code> blocks. Phrase-level within paragraphs, not whole-document.</p>

        <h3>Artifice Layer System</h3>

        <p>Documents have multiple depth layers measured by Artifice. Highest number = most constructed (fiction), presented first. Zero = no artifice (raw). Container gets <code>data-layers</code>, content divs get <code>data-layer="N"</code> with <code>data-layer-name</code> and <code>data-layer-classification</code>. Controls: depth gauge, pips, ↓ LESS ARTIFICE / ↑ MORE ARTIFICE buttons. Transition: dissolve (0.7s) → reform (0.8s).</p>

        <h3>VU Meter</h3>

        <p>Canvas-rendered analog meter with needle. Web Audio API AnalyserNode. Green RECEIVE TRANSMISSION label. Needle pivot at cy = H*0.88, BASE_ANGLE = -π/2, sweep ±0.75 radians.</p>

        <h2>Writing Process</h2>

        <p>Six phases: (1) Exploration — conversation, divergent thinking. (2) Solidification — document decisions. (3) Writing — human solo, AI not involved, prose 100% human. (4) Analysis — AI reads draft as reader first, then analyst. (5) Recontextualization — update documents to match what draft discovered. (6) Deepening — find resonances, add complexity. Core principle: the human writes the story, the AI holds the complexity.</p>

        <h2>Story Summary</h2>

        <div data-spoiler="7"><p>Marcus Reed was inside the CZ when the weapon deployed. He encountered Isla at Land's End — a neuroscientist with high-functioning autism whose Octopus Mind lets her maintain stable reality. He fled, was rescued, stole a sailboat to return. What the listener doesn't know: Marcus has completed this journey many times. He built a self-resetting automation. He discovered Isla's son Leo (age 7) didn't die — his fluid child consciousness manifests as an octopus. Isla plans revenge. Marcus needs to transform her emotionally so she can be reunited with Leo.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="9"><p>The 12 episodes are Marcus performing past confusion to carry Isla and the listener from wanting revenge to releasing it. The transmissions themselves are the weapon/gift — the story IS the mechanism. Days repeat as loops. The octopus encounter recurs identically. By Episode 7, Marcus "discovers" loops — the careful listener realizes he's known all along.</p></div>

        <div data-spoiler="11"><p>Key characters: Marcus Reed (The Bridge), Isla (Octopus Mind), Leo (fluid child consciousness), Marcus's father (dementia as metaphor for automation failure), David Chen (first survivor), Sarah Vickers (moral permission for revenge). The transmissions ARE the final fata organa — the story that traps Isla in Marcus's maintained reality to transform her.</p></div>

        <h2>Key Documents</h2>

        <p>All working documents are version-controlled in <code>_project/docs/</code> in the repo: the world bible, beat map, terminology dictionary, story threads overview, Isla &amp; Leo backstory, transmission grid, Episode 1 guide, writing process meta, writing process starter prompt, and presentation slides. When documents are updated in any workstream, they should be pushed to <code>_project/docs/</code> to keep the repo as single source of truth.</p>

        <h2>Reinitialization</h2>

        <p>1. Examine the repo at <code>github.com/wileydavis/fata-organa</code>. 2. Read this document (you are doing this now). 3. Set up <code>gh_push.py</code> with a valid GitHub token. 4. Local working directory: <code>/home/claude/site/</code> — mirror the repo structure. 5. Push changes with <code>push_file(repo_path, content, message)</code>. 6. Cloudflare auto-deploys. 7. Live site: <code>fata-organa.pages.dev</code>.</p>
