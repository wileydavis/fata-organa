            <h3 class="term-name">Automations</h3>
            <p>The unconscious systems humanity built over millennia to make reality <span data-spoiler="2">self-maintaining</span>. Originally, humans — <span data-spoiler="3">Minds</span> — could <span data-spoiler="2">shape reality with conscious thought</span>, but this required enormous effort. They built automations to handle <span data-spoiler="2">physics, causality, time, bodily processes</span>, and all the complex workings of existence. Over generations, humanity <span data-spoiler="3">forgot they had created these systems</span> and became trapped in <span data-spoiler="3">determinism</span>. The <span data-spoiler="6">weapon</span> destroyed these automations within the Containment Zone, <span data-spoiler="6">restoring humanity's original power</span> but leaving most <span data-spoiler="3">unable to consciously maintain reality</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Containment Zone (CZ)</h3>
            <p>The area affected by the <span data-spoiler="6">weapon</span> — roughly <span data-spoiler="1">the North American continent</span>. Inside the CZ, automations no longer function. Reality must be <span data-spoiler="2">consciously maintained by individual Minds</span>. Outside the CZ, the rest of the world continues as before, believing automations are simply "the laws of physics." The boundary is <span data-spoiler="1">patrolled by international naval forces</span>. Entry is prohibited. Exit is <span data-spoiler="2">rare and traumatic</span>.</p>

        <div class="term">
            <h3 class="term-name" data-spoiler="3">The Weapon / The Gift</h3>
            <p>The device deployed by a <span data-spoiler="7">collective of Minds</span> who discovered the truth about automations and sought to <span data-spoiler="6">destroy them</span>. They believed they were <span data-spoiler="6">freeing humanity from unconscious servitude</span> to automated systems. The weapon succeeded — within its range, all automations were <span data-spoiler="6">permanently disabled</span>. Whether this was an act of <span data-spoiler="6">liberation</span> or <span data-spoiler="6">mass murder</span> depends on your perspective. Those inside call it "the weapon." Those who understand what it revealed might call it "<span data-spoiler="9">the gift</span>." The story holds both interpretations in tension.</p>

            <p>Borrowed from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows: the moment of glimpsing someone's <span data-spoiler="2">real self through a gap in their performance</span>. Seeing backstage while the curtain is still up. In this world, the automations were humanity's <span data-spoiler="3">performance — the curtain hiding our true nature as reality-shapers</span>. The CZ <span data-spoiler="3">tears away that curtain</span>, exposing <span data-spoiler="2">raw consciousness</span>. Every encounter with a <span data-spoiler="2">trapped mind</span>, every moment of <span data-spoiler="2">consciousness bleeding</span>, every glimpse of <span data-spoiler="2">true self</span> is a fata organa.

            <p>The weapon was built by <span data-spoiler="7">Collective Minds</span> who wanted to restore humanity's original <span data-spoiler="6">consciousness-shaping abilities</span>. But the weapon <span data-spoiler="7">disproportionately killed Collective Minds</span> (who spread themselves thin trying to help others) and primarily <span data-spoiler="7">benefited Octopus Minds</span> (who could maintain themselves alone). The revolutionaries <span data-spoiler="7">destroyed the system that benefited collectivists</span> and created conditions that <span data-spoiler="7">favored individualists</span> — the opposite of their intent.</p>

        <div class="term">
            <h3 class="term-name" data-spoiler="3">Minds</h3>
            <p>The fundamental term for <span data-spoiler="3">conscious beings</span> in this world. All humans are <span data-spoiler="3">Minds</span> — entities capable of <span data-spoiler="3">shaping reality through consciousness</span>. Before automations, this was conscious and effortful. After automations, it became unconscious and automatic. After the <span data-spoiler="6">weapon</span>, it is conscious again but most have <span data-spoiler="3">lost the skills</span>.</p>

        <div class="term" data-spoiler="3">
            <h3 class="term-name">Collective Minds</h3>
            <p>Individuals who instinctively maintain reality through <span data-spoiler="3">cooperation with others</span>. Before automations, they worked in concert — "you hold <span data-spoiler="3">gravity</span> today, I'll maintain <span data-spoiler="3">molecular coherence</span>." They rotated responsibilities, shared the burden, and maintained reality as a <span data-spoiler="3">collective project</span>. Deep social bonds were essential for survival. After the weapon, most Collective-minded people <span data-spoiler="7">died because they tried to help others</span> and spread themselves too thin, <span data-spoiler="7">unable to maintain themselves alone</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Octopus Minds</h3>
            <p>Named for octopus intelligence — <span data-spoiler="3">solitary, distributed, self-sufficient</span>. Individuals who can maintain personal reality <span data-spoiler="3">alone without collective support</span>. Before automations, they preferred isolation, found collective maintenance <span data-spoiler="3">exhausting and intrusive</span>. More creative, unstable, experimental. After the weapon, Octopus Minds <span data-spoiler="7">survived because they could maintain themselves individually</span>. The irony: the weapon <span data-spoiler="7">meant to eliminate them</span> is what allowed them to <span data-spoiler="7">thrive</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Pure Octopus Mind</h3>
            <p>An Octopus Mind who operates exclusively through <span data-spoiler="6">individual maintenance</span> with no need for collective support. Completely self-sufficient, can maintain stable reality <span data-spoiler="6">indefinitely alone</span>. No fear of isolation — comfortable in complete solitude. <span data-spoiler="6">Isla</span> is the primary example: her <span data-spoiler="6">neurodivergent cognition</span> made her naturally suited to independent reality maintenance, though this same trait contributed to her <span data-spoiler="7">separation from her child</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Hybrid Minds</h3>
            <p>Individuals who can operate in <span data-spoiler="5">both collective and individual modes</span>. Before automations, they joined collectives for major projects, isolated for personal work. <span data-spoiler="5">Mediators</span> between the two approaches. Often the <span data-spoiler="5">most powerful reality-shapers</span>, also the most conflicted. <span data-spoiler="5">Marcus</span> is a Hybrid — capable of both <span data-spoiler="5">individual maintenance</span> and <span data-spoiler="5">bridging into others' consciousness</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Child Minds</h3>
            <p>Consciousness in children operates differently — more <span data-spoiler="6">fluid</span>, less fixed, naturally <span data-spoiler="6">adaptive</span>. Child Minds don't cling to <span data-spoiler="6">rigid self-identity</span> the way adults do. They haven't yet <span data-spoiler="6">automated their consciousness</span> into fixed patterns. This fluidity makes them naturally suited to post-weapon reality, able to <span data-spoiler="6">shift between collective and individual maintenance instinctively</span>. <span data-spoiler="6">Leo</span> is the primary example: his consciousness <span data-spoiler="8">flows like water rather than holding shape like stone</span>.</p>

            <p>Consciousnesses that have <span data-spoiler="2">lost the ability to maintain physical form</span> but <span data-spoiler="5">cannot disperse</span>. Unique to the post-weapon CZ. They cannot maintain form (<span data-spoiler="3">lost reality maintenance skills</span>), cannot disperse (<span data-spoiler="5">lost death skills</span>), and instinctively <span data-spoiler="2">cling to coherence</span> because they only know "stay whole = survive." The result: <span data-spoiler="2">eternal awareness without body</span>, locked between existence and non-existence. Horror: <span data-spoiler="3">holding themselves together out of habit and fear</span>. Hundreds or thousands scattered throughout the zone as a permanent landscape of <span data-spoiler="2">ambient suffering</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name" data-spoiler="2">Consciousness Bleeding</h3>
            <p>The involuntary leaking of one Mind's <span data-spoiler="2">maintained reality into another's perception</span>. In the CZ, without automated boundaries between consciousnesses, <span data-spoiler="2">thoughts, memories, and sensory experiences</span> can bleed between nearby Minds. The experience ranges from mild (<span data-spoiler="2">sensing another's emotional state</span>) to overwhelming (<span data-spoiler="3">losing track of which memories are yours</span>). <span data-spoiler="5">Marcus's Hybrid nature</span> makes him especially susceptible — and eventually, this vulnerability becomes his <span data-spoiler="9">greatest tool</span>.</p>

            <p>The natural state of <span data-spoiler="6">Child Minds</span> — consciousness that <span data-spoiler="6">flows between modes</span> rather than being fixed. <span data-spoiler="6">Leo's</span> consciousness doesn't hold a <span data-spoiler="6">rigid shape</span>. It <span data-spoiler="8">adapts, shifts, merges, and separates</span> as needed. This is what <span data-spoiler="6">pre-automation consciousness</span> looked like: not a fixed point but a <span data-spoiler="6">living process</span>. Adults <span data-spoiler="6">lost this fluidity</span> through millennia of automated consciousness. Children haven't yet.</p>

            <p>Reality that is being <span data-spoiler="2">actively held in a coherent state</span> by one or more Minds. Inside the CZ, <span data-spoiler="2">nothing exists passively</span> — every physical law, every object's coherence, every moment of stable time is the product of <span data-spoiler="2">conscious effort</span>. The quality of maintained reality varies: a powerful Mind creates stability <span data-spoiler="3">indistinguishable from pre-weapon physics</span>. A struggling Mind creates reality that <span data-spoiler="2">shimmers, fragments, contradicts itself</span>.</p>

            <p>Reality maintenance performed by <span data-spoiler="3">a single Mind working alone</span>. The Octopus approach. More stable for the individual but <span data-spoiler="3">limited in scope</span> — you can maintain your own body, your immediate surroundings, and not much else. <span data-spoiler="3">Exhausting over long periods</span>.

            <p>Reality maintenance performed by <span data-spoiler="3">multiple Minds working in concert</span>. The pre-automation default. More powerful and sustainable than individual maintenance — a group can <span data-spoiler="3">maintain vast areas of stable reality</span> while individuals rest. Requires <span data-spoiler="3">trust, communication, and shared intent</span>. Largely <span data-spoiler="7">extinct within the CZ</span> after the weapon killed most Collective Minds.</p>

            <p>The active, intentional <span data-spoiler="3">manipulation of maintained reality</span>. Beyond merely holding reality stable, a sufficiently skilled Mind can <span data-spoiler="3">reshape it</span> — changing physical laws, altering the landscape, <span data-spoiler="3">creating or destroying matter</span>. This was once an <span data-spoiler="3">art form</span>, practiced by master Minds before automations made the skill unnecessary.

            <p>The pre-automation practice of <span data-spoiler="5">conscious, intentional death</span>. A dying Mind <span data-spoiler="5">broke consciousness into small pieces</span>, distributing each to <span data-spoiler="5">loved ones and community</span>. Each piece was small enough that the recipient absorbed it without losing identity. The dying Mind <span data-spoiler="5">gradually dissolved</span> — true death through <span data-spoiler="5">willing fragmentation</span>. Ritualized, sacred, honored.

            <h3 class="term-name">Grief Storms</h3>
            <p>Reality disturbances caused by the concentrated <span data-spoiler="4">grief, rage, or despair</span> of powerful Minds. Emotional states so intense they <span data-spoiler="4">destabilize maintained reality</span> in a wide radius. Unpredictable, dangerous, and one of the primary hazards of travel through the zone. <span data-spoiler="4">Isla's grief</span> creates some of the <span data-spoiler="7">largest storms in the CZ</span>.</p>

        <div class="term" data-spoiler="3">
            <h3 class="term-name">Reality Traps</h3>
            <p>Regions where maintained reality has become <span data-spoiler="3">self-reinforcing in destructive patterns</span>. A Mind's last desperate attempt at maintenance, <span data-spoiler="3">frozen in a loop</span>. Enter a reality trap and you may find yourself in a pocket of seemingly stable reality — <span data-spoiler="3">a kitchen, a living room, a park</span> — that won't let you leave. The trapped Mind that created it <span data-spoiler="3">holds the space together reflexively</span>, and your presence gives it <span data-spoiler="3">more consciousness to feed on</span>.</p>

        <div class="term">
            <h3 class="term-name">Marcus Reed</h3>
            <p>The primary narrator. A <span data-spoiler="5">Hybrid Mind</span> who survived the CZ and was found <span data-spoiler="1">adrift outside the boundary</span>. After recovering <span data-spoiler="1">fragments of memory</span> in <span data-spoiler="1">Lisbon</span>, he <span data-spoiler="1">steals a sailboat</span> and returns to the zone, compelled by a <span data-spoiler="1">recurring dream of a woman</span> at <span data-spoiler="1">Land's End</span>. His transmissions form the structure of the story. His <span data-spoiler="5">hybrid nature</span> — able to operate both individually and collectively — makes him uniquely suited to <span data-spoiler="5">bridge the gap</span> between <span data-spoiler="4">Isla</span> and the rest of the zone's survivors.</p>

        <div class="term" data-spoiler="4">
            <h3 class="term-name">Isla</h3>
            <p>A <span data-spoiler="4">neuroscientist</span> and <span data-spoiler="6">Pure Octopus Mind</span>. Was at <span data-spoiler="4">Land's End</span> working in isolation when the weapon was deployed. A <span data-spoiler="4">single mother</span> — her child, <span data-spoiler="6">Leo</span>, was staying with a caretaker at "<span data-spoiler="4">the center</span>." Her <span data-spoiler="6">autism</span> (never named, shown through her characteristics) drives her Octopus nature: <span data-spoiler="6">independent processing, comfort with solitude, direct cognition</span>. Survived because her <span data-spoiler="6">neurodivergent mind</span> was already suited to individual maintenance. Her <span data-spoiler="7">guilt over leaving Leo</span> drives everything she does in the zone.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Leo</h3>
            <p><span data-spoiler="4">Isla's</span> child. A <span data-spoiler="6">Child Mind</span> whose <span data-spoiler="6">fluid consciousness</span> allowed him to survive the weapon in a form <span data-spoiler="8">adults cannot achieve</span>. Leo did not become a trapped mind because <span data-spoiler="6">children don't cling to fixed identity</span> the way adults do. What happened to him — <span data-spoiler="9">where he is</span>, <span data-spoiler="9">what form his consciousness takes</span> — is the central mystery driving <span data-spoiler="7">Isla's journey</span>. He is <span data-spoiler="11">hope embodied</span>: proof that consciousness can <span data-spoiler="11">adapt rather than merely endure or break</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">The Bridge</h3>
            <p>What <span data-spoiler="5">Marcus becomes</span>: the connection between <span data-spoiler="5">Isla's isolated Octopus nature</span> and the <span data-spoiler="9">collective healing</span> the zone needs. His <span data-spoiler="5">Hybrid Mind</span> can reach Isla where no <span data-spoiler="5">Collective Mind could</span> (she'd reject the intrusion) and connect her to others in ways no <span data-spoiler="5">Octopus Mind could</span> (they couldn't bridge to her). His role is not to <span data-spoiler="9">fix Isla</span> but to create the conditions where <span data-spoiler="9">reunion with Leo</span> becomes possible.</p>

        <div class="term" data-spoiler="7">
            <h3 class="term-name">The Weapon-Deployers</h3>
            <p>The collective of Minds who <span data-spoiler="7">built and deployed the weapon</span>. They believed they were <span data-spoiler="7">liberating humanity</span> from automated consciousness. They were <span data-spoiler="7">Collective Minds</span> — believed deeply in <span data-spoiler="7">shared experience and cooperative reality</span>. The irony: their weapon <span data-spoiler="7">destroyed the system that supported their way of life</span> and created conditions that <span data-spoiler="7">favored their philosophical opposites</span>. Most <span data-spoiler="7">died in the aftermath</span>, victims of their own liberation.</p>

            <p>A real octopus that Marcus encounters in the <span data-spoiler="9">waters off the coast</span> — solitary, intelligent, alien in its cognition. Becomes a motif: the octopus represents the <span data-spoiler="9">Octopus Mind in its purest form</span>. Distributed intelligence, no need for others, comfortable in the deep and the dark. The octopus appears in <span data-spoiler="9">multiple iterations</span> of Marcus's journey, each time revealing something new about <span data-spoiler="9">solitary consciousness</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">The Sailboat</h3>
            <p>The boat Marcus <span data-spoiler="1">steals in Lisbon</span> to return to the CZ. A small vessel — intimate, vulnerable, requiring <span data-spoiler="1">constant attention</span> to maintain. The sailboat is Marcus's first lesson in <span data-spoiler="2">individual maintenance</span>: the boat doesn't sail itself, the sea doesn't cooperate automatically. Everything requires <span data-spoiler="2">conscious effort</span>. The boat becomes an extension of his <span data-spoiler="2">maintained reality</span>, and its condition mirrors his <span data-spoiler="8">psychological state across loops</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Individual vs. Collective</h3>
            <p>The central philosophical tension. Before automations, both modes of consciousness <span data-spoiler="9">coexisted in dynamic tension</span>. The weapon forced a reckoning: which mode of being is more <span data-spoiler="9">authentic</span>? More <span data-spoiler="9">sustainable</span>? More <span data-spoiler="9">human</span>? The story <span data-spoiler="11">refuses to pick a side</span>. Collective consciousness offers <span data-spoiler="9">belonging</span> but demands <span data-spoiler="9">conformity</span>. Individual consciousness offers <span data-spoiler="9">freedom</span> but guarantees <span data-spoiler="9">isolation</span>. The resolution is <span data-spoiler="11">family</span> — chosen small groups, <span data-spoiler="11">natural collectives</span> rather than imposed ones.</p>

            <p>The question: is the ability to <span data-spoiler="5">truly die</span> essential to bearable existence? <span data-spoiler="5">Marcus's father's dementia</span> — watching consciousness become <span data-spoiler="5">trapped by failing mental systems</span> — prepared Marcus to understand trapped minds. Both his father and the zone's trapped minds suffer from the same condition: <span data-spoiler="5">awareness without agency</span>, presence without ability. Teaching <span data-spoiler="5">dispersal</span> (conscious death) could <span data-spoiler="5">free trapped minds</span>. Should consciousness ever be <span data-spoiler="5">eternal</span>?</p>

            <h3 class="term-name">Family as the Third Way</h3>
            <p>The resolution to the <span data-spoiler="11">individual vs. collective</span> debate. Not large enforced collectives (<span data-spoiler="11">conformity, lost individuality</span>). Not pure isolated individuals (<span data-spoiler="11">tyranny, loneliness</span>). But <span data-spoiler="11">chosen small groups</span>: parent-child, partners, families. Natural collective rather than imposed. Connection from <span data-spoiler="11">strength and choice</span>, not need or force. <span data-spoiler="11">Marcus</span> (Hybrid) + <span data-spoiler="11">Isla</span> (Octopus) + <span data-spoiler="11">Leo</span> (fluid child) = the model for <span data-spoiler="11">future survival</span>.</p>
