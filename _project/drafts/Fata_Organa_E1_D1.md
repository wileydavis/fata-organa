Fata Organa

INT. SAILBOAT RADIO ROOM - COLD OPEN
MARCUS

I have this recurring dream about a woman sitting on the beach at Land's End and staring at the sea.

There's no one else around, and I think that's been true for a very long time, but she's there staring at the sea and waiting, I'm certain of it, for me.

In this dream, I'm overwhelmed by a great feeling of relief.

She exists. 

Something else besides me that seems to admit to a notion of cause and effect.

I fall to my knees on the sand next to her and I cry, and though she never once looks my way, I'm grateful. Because her presence confirms mine.

She continues staring at the sea and just before I wake she whispers loud enough for me to hear above the wind and the crash of the waves. She whispers.

They thought it was a weapon. But it's a gift.

INT. SAILBOAT RADIO ROOM - COLD OPEN
MARCUS

I am told that a French naval vessel found me 200 nautical miles outside the North American containment zone, adrift in an open fishing boat, sunburnt and conscious, but unresponsive.

I don't remember this.

I have no memory in the normal sense of what I was before waking up on that ship.

It's not amnesia. I have memories, but they're less than coherent, like they've been broken down to the tiniest fragment possible and mixed into a slurry that feels so very heavy, solid, tangible, but completely meaningless.

I never told them about my dream, but I know where it took place. I can't shake the feeling that I made a mistake there and that I have to go back.

INT. SAILBOAT RADIO ROOM - FRAME
MARCUS

You can call me Marcus. That's what I'm told I was called before the Adjustment, as they refer to it, and various tangible facts about myself apparently confirm that. My fingerprints. My face. My gait. Something about the patterns of my electrical conductivity.

All of these seem to solidify an identity that my rescuers were satisfied with. Satisfied enough to change my status from refugee to resident with a capital R. They played this up as a generous turn of events but given the fact that I was the only person to make it out of the Containment Zone I have trouble believing it was much of an inconvenience on their part.

But hey, If they're satisfied, I'm satisfied.

[the users of the weapon were prepared to receive mass refugees from the result of using the weapon and were prepared to take excellent care of them and integrate them. But Marcus was the only refugee that made it out.]

We work with the circumstances we're given. I believe that names can have power but in this world they're just names. So Marcus is fine by me.

This message you're hearing now is being transmitted from a small sailboat (an Alubat Cigale 14, not that it matters to anyone, except the people I stole if from, probably). I'm transmitting on frequency 146.520 and will continue to do so as I approach the containment zone. Possibly even once I'm well inside it.

It's certainly a risk. I'm sure someone out there is listening.

I'm sure some of them can even triangulate my position from these broadcasts, but I'm so close now I don't think it will matter.

I will already be inside the Containment Zone and no one will follow me there. 

Part of me wonders if they let me get away, so that they could observe what happens.

I think they're terrified of what they've done.

They'd been given the technique by a computer system more complicated than they are, but had no way to understand its nature. They thought they knew what they were dealing with but now they know better.

An evil you don't understand is frightening enough, but the evils we unleash from our own hubris somehow grab hold at the very root of our amygdala and squeeze every drop of fear out of that little bean. The oija board, the nuclear meltdown, the pathogen that escapes the lab.

From everything I saw during my time in Quito, they're drowning in that fear. They're afraid that what they've done makes them evil. They're afraid that what they've done will spread beyond the Containment Zone. They're afraid because they've stumbled upon an anomaly and if there's a single word in the dictionary that represents everything we've been evolved to fear, an anomaly fits the bill precisely.

But I am not afraid. Not because I am brave or ignorant or fatalistic. I am not afraid because the woman in my dream has given me a deep intuition that the Containment Zone represents a truth. And that the anomaly to be feared is the stability we as a species have always known.

I also recognize that this might just be my own form of hubris. That I might be sailing my way back toward some terrible thing that I was lucky to have escaped and should leave well enough alone.

It's taken me thirty two days to get here but in the last two I've started to feel something changing. A loosening of the mental cartilage. A slight racking of the embedded bones that make Marcus Marcus. A recession of the container and the wall and the line formed by the pollution of time.

My hope is that these transmissions will help maintain my own coherence somehow.

I'm recording them for my own recall but there's something important in the act of transmission itself. Call it an intuition, a hunch, whatever term you like, but the need to transmit has been growing over the last few days.

A longing... like a desperate need to hold the hand of a lost love. A longing you wish you couldn't feel.

I found myself lingering every time I'd walk by the radio. Staring in lost time at the radio mic, designed to fit so plumbly in the hand, begging for me to key the button. It's spiral cord plugged into the radio itself, just a metal box with a few knobs and a simple screen showing only a few numbers, 146.520.

And from there a cable snaking through the boat and up the mast to the antenna. An energy flow from brain, to vocal chords, to frequency generator, to antenna, to energy, a bounce perhaps off the ionosphere and then to... where?

I don't know but it's a connection I have become overwhelmed with wanting.

Someone may be hearing this. Someone may be listening. And someone may be receiving. 

I'm going in the same way I came out. By the sea. Aiming for Land's End where my dream took place. And with each mile I beat against this headwind, the feeling as time disintegrates grows heavy.

But it's a weight that does not settle into the earth as an immovable stone but rather gently drifts across the plane as if on a sheet of ice or a thin cushion of air.

An immense density but moveable with just a touch.

I too am drowning in what has been done. But not in fear.

INT. SAILBOAT RADIO ROOM - THE DESTROYER
MARCUS

[conduit ask asking]
I often find myself thinking of Captain Beaumont. His was the first face I saw when I reemerged as something identifiably Marcus. But I can't recall his face at all... only his grey-blue eyes locked on mine in what would normally be an overwhelming amount of eye contact, but here, as those strange memories that aren't memories settled into their Marcus-shaped positions, I found Beaumont's stare to be a conduit. Like a tractor beam reeling me up from the depths.

Is Beaumont out here somewhere, sailing these waters in search of other survivors? Or is he secretly tailing me with his giant ship, somewhere in my wake just beyond the horizon, waiting and watching with those grey-blue eyes to see what happens as I disappear into the anomaly?

Are you out there, Beaumont? Are you hearing this transmission now as I speak into this mic? Have we formed the great connective loop?

Somehow I don't think so. You may be listening, but someone else, I think, is receiving.

As I've said, I don't know how I got on that fishing boat. I don't remember being pulled up into the ship. But I remember Beaumont. And I remember the unceasing hum of the ship's engines. I remember the grey steel walls and being shocked at how every one of them seemed to bristle with rivets. What a strange thing to fixate on given the circumstances, I remember thinking.

And once I broke free from the conduit of Captain Beaumont's stare, I noticed something else.

A curious fear in those eyes.

In time I realized that I was the cause of this fear. And in the weeks I spent on the ship, I'd come to see that same curious fear in the crew as well.

The way they'd give wide berth in narrow passageways but linger after passing as if to ask a question, only to lose courage at the last moment.

In time I'd learn the reason for this.

In time I would learn that I'm the only person who has made it out of the Containment Zone.

For three months they'd been looking and looking to no avail.

Until they found me in that fishing boat, they were starting to wonder if there would be any survivors at all.

INT. SAILBOAT RADIO ROOM - QUITO
MARCUS

I discovered this fact aboard the ship but when we docked in Quito and Beaumont placed me into the hands of the official Pacific Refugee Authority, the gravity of the situation became distinctly obvious.

The KPR had wanted to win the war, of course, but had no intentions of anything like extermination or vengeance, and they had been prepared to build the necessary facilities to reintegrate hundreds of thousands of refugees.

They'd intended to build these facilities all along the North American coastlines but when it became apparent that they were unable to go into the Containment Zone and that no one seemed to be coming out of it, they revised their plans and built several camps far enough from the CZ to be deemed safe. Quito was the nearest one to that little dot in the ocean where Beaumont found me bobbing up and down adrift well beyond any sense of boundary. So that's where I was taken.

Upon arrival it was obvious to me that even these revised plans that they'd made were grossly optimistic.

You could hear it in the receiving plaza that made punctuated echos of my footsteps as I walked across it. You could see it in the rows upon rows of perfect but empty tents. You could feel it in the way that the staff looked at one another amidst all this emptiness, deprived of any chance to assuage their guilt with good deeds. And you could see it in the way they looked at me, as a desperate glimpse of hope but also a reminder that this hope would not be enough.

INT. SAILBOAT RADIO ROOM - CAFE FATA ORGANA
MARCUS
I'd been in Quito for six months when my memories started to return. Not all at once. Just little dribs and drabs that somehow managed to pierce the overwhelming dream of the woman at Land's End... a dream that has not left my side. A dream that seems to define me with an authority that even these returning memories can't command. I wanted to welcome them home and give them their rightful place by the hearth but I couldn't.

Strangely, the return of time upset me the most. Like the tinglings of a cough you thought you'd beaten. Time. Time. Time.

When it returned to me the first thing it did was to draw a line in my mind. A line that became a border. A border that became a wall. A wall that became a container. A container that held Marcus, as we know him now, from spilling out all over the sidewalk as he walked down the noisy streets of Quito.

The first of these memories took place just weeks before the Adjustment.
