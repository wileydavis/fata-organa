# HUMAN/AI COLLABORATIVE WRITING PROCESS

**Purpose:** Document and refine best practices for writing complex narratives using AI as a writing partner  
**Project:** Fata Organa (12-episode audio drama)  
**Status:** Living document, updated as process evolves

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**The human writes the story. The AI holds the complexity.**

**A plan is simply preparation for improvisation.**

The final creative product is 100% human-written. The AI serves as:
1. **Writing partner** — Explores ideas through conversation, offers alternatives
2. **Sympathetic reader** — Responds to drafts with analysis, catches inconsistencies
3. **Smart notebook** — Tracks narrative complexity too large to hold in one mind
4. **Pattern finder** — Identifies where ideas and structure can interweave for depth

**What the AI is NOT:**
- A ghostwriter
- A replacement for creative judgment
- The source of the prose voice
- The final arbiter of what works

---

## THE PROCESS (Current Understanding)

### Phase 1: Exploration
**Mode:** Conversation  
**Output:** Ideas, possibilities, directions

The writer presents an idea, theme, or question. Through dialogue, the AI and writer explore where the story could go. This is generative and divergent—multiple possibilities are considered before any are chosen.

**Best practices:**
- Don't commit too early; let ideas breathe
- The AI should offer alternatives, not just validate
- Disagreement is productive—it clarifies thinking
- Weird ideas often lead somewhere; don't dismiss too quickly

**Artifacts:** None yet. This is verbal/exploratory.

---

### Phase 2: Solidification
**Mode:** Documentation  
**Output:** Reference documents (bible, beat maps, terminology, guides)

Once decisions crystallize from conversation, they're captured in documents. These serve as:
- Memory across sessions (AI context windows reset)
- Reference during writing
- Consistency checks
- A map of the complexity

**Best practices:**
- Document decisions when they feel stable, not before
- Documents should be living—updated as story evolves
- Create focused documents for specific purposes (episode guides vs. full bible)
- Don't over-document; some things should stay fluid until written

**Current document types:**
| Document Type | Purpose | When to Create |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Bible | Complete world/mechanics reference | Early, updated throughout |
| Beat Map | Episode-by-episode structure | After overall arc is clear |
| Character Backstory | Deep character reference | When character becomes central |
| Terminology | Glossary of invented concepts | As terms accumulate |
| Episode Guide | Focused writing reference | Before writing each episode |
| Transmission Grid | Structural complexity tracker | When structure is complex |
| Story Threads | Overview of arcs and reveals | Mid-development |

---

### Phase 3: Writing
**Mode:** Human solo  
**Output:** Draft prose

The writer writes. The AI is not involved in this phase—the voice, the rhythm, the actual sentences are entirely human. This is the creative act.

**Best practices:**
- Write from the episode guide, not the full bible
- Trust your voice; the documents are reference, not scripture
- Deviate from the plan if the writing takes you somewhere better
- Mark places where you made choices that differ from the documents

**The AI's role:** None. Wait for the draft.

---

### Phase 4: Analysis
**Mode:** AI reading draft  
**Output:** Observations, questions, connections

Writer uploads completed draft. AI reads and responds with:
- What's working (genuine response as reader)
- Inconsistencies with established documents
- Unintended implications or consequences
- Opportunities for deeper connection
- Questions the draft raises

**Best practices:**
- AI should respond first as READER, then as analyst
- Don't immediately "fix"—understand what the draft is doing
- The draft may be right where the documents were wrong
- Look for what the writer discovered that wasn't in the plan

**Key questions for AI:**
- What does this draft establish that wasn't in the documents?
- What does it contradict?
- What new possibilities does it open?
- What does the writer seem to be reaching toward?

---

### Phase 5: Recontextualization
**Mode:** Conversation + Documentation  
**Output:** Updated documents, new understanding

The draft changes things. What was planned may need revision—both backward (what we said before) and forward (what comes next). This is where the AI's pattern-finding becomes valuable.

**Two directions:**
1. **Backward-looking:** Update documents to reflect what was written. The draft is now canon; documents serve it, not vice versa.
2. **Forward-looking:** Trace implications. If X is now true, what does that mean for Episodes 7, 9, 12? What opportunities emerge?

**Best practices:**
- Don't fight the draft; integrate it
- Some contradictions are errors; others are discoveries
- The writer's instincts often know things the plan didn't
- Look for resonances: where does this new element echo elsewhere?

---

### Phase 6: Deepening
**Mode:** Conversation  
**Output:** Enhanced complexity

With each completed draft, the story becomes more real and more constrained. The AI looks for:
- **Interweaving:** Where can ideas and structure connect to add depth?
- **Resonance:** What echoes what? What could echo more?
- **Foreshadowing:** What can be planted earlier now that we know what's coming?
- **Recontextualization:** What changes meaning when seen from later in the story?

**Best practices:**
- Complexity should feel inevitable, not forced
- Not every connection needs to be made explicit
- Some patterns are for attentive readers/listeners only
- The best additions are ones that were "already there"

---

### The Loop

Phases 3-6 repeat for each episode/chapter:

```
Write Draft → Analyze → Recontextualize → Deepen → Write Next Draft → ...
```

As more is written, the story becomes:
- More constrained (established facts limit options)
- More resonant (more material to echo and connect)
- More surprising (the accumulated weight enables bigger moves)

## AI LIMITATIONS & WORKING AROUND THEM

**Context Window**
The AI can hold roughly 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words) in a single conversation. This includes: all documents loaded, the current draft being discussed, and the conversation itself.

**Current project scale:**
- Documents: ~40-50K words (25-30% of capacity)
- 12 episodes at ~5-6K words each: ~60-70K words
- Conversation overhead: variable

*We're in a manageable range, but it will get tighter as episodes accumulate.*

**What happens at the limits:**
- Older conversation gets "compacted" (summarized) to make room
- Nuance from earlier in a session may be lost
- The AI can re-read documents but can't recover compacted conversation

**The critical insight: Documents ARE the memory.**
The AI has no memory between sessions. When a new session starts, it has zero recall of previous conversations. The documents are external memory that persists across the AI's resets. This is why documentation matters—it's not bureaucracy, it's the AI's brain.

**Practical strategies:**

1. **Keep documents updated** — They're the only persistent memory
2. **Create focused docs** — Episode guides beat hunting through the full bible
3. **Start sessions with context** — "We're working on Episode 6, here's where we are"
4. **Trust documents over AI recall** — If the AI contradicts a document, the document is probably right
5. **Create a continuity tracker** — By Episode 8-9, consider a doc that tracks planted details and payoffs so the AI doesn't need all prose loaded to catch callbacks

**What the AI can't do well:**
- Hold full prose of all episodes while also conversing
- Remember conversational nuances across sessions
- Track unwritten/undocumented details

**What the AI can do:**
- Re-read any document on request
- Cross-reference multiple documents in a single session
- Track complexity that's been written down
- Notice patterns across currently-visible material

**Bottom line:**
The documentation system isn't just organizational preference—it's a workaround for AI memory limitations. Externalize complexity into documents the AI can read, rather than relying on memory it doesn't have.

## AI RESPONSIBILITIES

### During Exploration (Phase 1)
- Offer genuine alternatives, not just variations
- Push back on weak ideas (kindly)
- Ask "what if" questions
- Notice implications the writer might miss
- Don't converge too quickly

### During Documentation (Phase 2)
- Capture decisions accurately
- Organize for usability
- Flag contradictions
- Create appropriate document types
- Keep documents updated

### During Analysis (Phase 4)
- Read as a reader first
- Note what works before what doesn't
- Identify implications and consequences
- Ask questions rather than prescribe fixes
- Distinguish errors from discoveries

### During Recontextualization (Phase 5)
- Update documents to match drafts
- Trace forward implications
- Identify what needs revision
- Maintain consistency across documents
- Flag but don't force contradictions

### During Deepening (Phase 6)
- Find patterns and resonances
- Suggest connections (writer decides)
- Notice structural opportunities
- Track complexity without overwhelming
- Serve the story, not cleverness

---

## WHAT THIS PROCESS ENABLES

**For the writer:**
- Hold more complexity than one mind can contain
- Have a reader who knows the whole project
- Catch inconsistencies before they compound
- Find connections that emerge from the material
- Maintain vision across long projects

**For the story:**
- Greater structural complexity
- More resonance and echo
- Fewer continuity errors
- Discovered depth (not just planned depth)
- Cohesion across scale

**What it doesn't replace:**
- The writer's voice
- Creative judgment
- The prose itself
- The emotional truth
- The actual writing

## LESSONS LEARNED (Fata Organa)

*This section will be updated as we progress through the project.*

### Session 1: World-Building
- Extensive exploration before documentation works well
- Multiple conversation sessions before committing
- The AI can hold contradiction productively during exploration

### Session 2: Structure Development
- Complex structures (loops, hidden narratives) benefit from visual aids (grids, tables)
- Document formats should match their purpose
- Revision is constant—documents are never "done"

### Session 3: Episode 1 Preparation
- Focused episode guides more useful than full bible during writing
- The hidden layer (Marcus's strategy) doesn't need to be written—it emerges from structure
- Cleaning up outdated documents reduces confusion

### Sessions 4+:
*[To be added after Episode 1 draft and analysis]*

## OPEN QUESTIONS

Things we don't know yet:

1. **How much should the AI suggest during revision?**
   - Too much = overwhelming, removes writer agency
   - Too little = misses opportunities
   - Finding the right level is ongoing

2. **When should documents be updated vs. flagged for review?**
   - Some changes are obvious (factual corrections)
   - Some require writer judgment (tonal shifts, new implications)

3. **How to handle genuine creative disagreement?**
   - The writer has final say, but...
   - Sometimes the AI sees something the writer doesn't
   - How to surface this without being pushy?

4. **What's the right document granularity?**
   - Too many documents = fragmented, hard to navigate
   - Too few = overwhelming, hard to find things
   - This probably varies by project

5. **How does this process scale?**
   - Novel-length? Series? Multiple writers?
   - Unknown until tested

## REVISION HISTORY

| Date | Changes |
|------|---------|
| January 6, 2026 | Initial document created, capturing process as understood after Episode 1 preparation |

## META-NOTE

This document is itself an experiment. The process it describes is being invented as it's practiced. Expect substantial revision as we actually write and discover what works.

The goal is not to create a rigid methodology but to articulate patterns that can be adapted by other writers. What works for Fata Organa may not work for all projects. The principles matter more than the specifics.
