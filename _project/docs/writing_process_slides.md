# WRITING WITH AI: A Collaborative Process
## Slide Deck for 3-Minute Presentation

---

## SLIDE 1: Title

**Writing With AI**
*Using AI as a writing partner, not a ghostwriter*

---

## SLIDE 2: The Core Idea

**The human writes the story. The AI holds the complexity.**

- Final prose is 100% human-written
- AI serves as partner, reader, and "smart notebook"
- Complex narratives require more than one mind can hold

---

## SLIDE 3: What AI Does Well

**Pattern-finding across scale**

- Track characters, timelines, planted details
- Catch inconsistencies before they compound
- Find resonances the writer didn't consciously plan
- Remember everything while you forget productively

---

## SLIDE 4: What AI Can't Do

**The actual writing**

- Voice and rhythm
- Emotional truth
- Creative judgment
- The prose itself

*These remain entirely human.*

---

## SLIDE 5: The Process (Six Phases)

1. **Explore** — Conversation, divergent thinking
2. **Solidify** — Document decisions
3. **Write** — Human solo, AI not involved
4. **Analyze** — AI reads draft as reader first
5. **Recontextualize** — Update backward and forward
6. **Deepen** — Find connections, add complexity

*Then repeat for each chapter/episode.*

## SLIDE 6: The Key Insight

**A plan is simply preparation for improvisation.**

- Documents serve the writing, not the other way around
- Writer's instincts often know things the outline didn't
- AI updates the map to match the territory you've discovered
- The more prepared you are, the freer you can be

---

## SLIDE 7: What This Enables

**Stories that are:**

- More structurally complex than one mind can track
- More internally consistent
- Richer in echo and resonance
- Discovered, not just planned

---

## SLIDE 8: Closing

**"The act of measuring changes what you're measuring."**

The process shapes the story.
The story shapes the process.
Both evolve together.

# PRESENTER NOTES

**Timing breakdown (3 minutes):**
- Slides 1-2: 30 seconds (setup)
- Slides 3-4: 45 seconds (what AI does/doesn't do)
- Slides 5-6: 60 seconds (the process — this is the meat)
- Slides 7-8: 45 seconds (payoff and close)

**Key points to emphasize verbally:**

*On Slide 3:* "I'm writing a 12-episode audio drama with nested timelines and a hidden narrative structure. I literally cannot hold all of it in my head at once. The AI can."

*On Slide 5:* "The crucial thing is Phase 3—the AI is NOT involved when I'm actually writing. The voice is mine. Then I upload the draft and we figure out what I discovered."

*On Slide 6:* "A plan is simply preparation for improvisation. All this documentation isn't a cage—it's what lets me be free when I'm actually writing. I know the AI has my back, so I can follow an instinct without worrying I'll break something. And if I do break something, we fix the plan, not the writing."

*On Slide 8:* "That quote is actually from the story I'm writing—a father teaching his son about precision measurement. But it applies here too. You can't observe a process without changing it. Documenting how I write with AI is changing how I write with AI."

**If you have extra time:**
Mention the "reader first, analyst second" principle—the AI should respond to your draft the way a trusted reader would before it starts finding problems.

**If you're running short:**
Cut Slide 7 and go straight from Slide 6 to closing.
